# Figure Descriptions

## Performance Comparison

Figure 1: Performance comparison across all evaluated algorithms. Box plots show the distribution of episode rewards for each algorithm across all test environments. Novel algorithms are highlighted in blue, baseline algorithms in gray. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

## Significance Heatmap

Figure 2: Statistical significance heatmap for pairwise algorithm comparisons. Color intensity indicates the magnitude of performance difference, with asterisks (*) marking statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Novel algorithms are compared against baseline algorithms.

## Safety Performance

Figure 3: Safety-performance trade-off analysis. Each point represents an algorithm's average performance (x-axis) vs. safety violations (y-axis). The Pareto frontier identifies algorithms with optimal trade-offs. Lower-right quadrant indicates superior algorithms (high performance, low violations).

## Convergence Analysis

Figure 4: Convergence time analysis across different network sizes. Lines show mean convergence time with shaded regions indicating standard error. Novel algorithms demonstrate improved scalability characteristics compared to baseline approaches.
