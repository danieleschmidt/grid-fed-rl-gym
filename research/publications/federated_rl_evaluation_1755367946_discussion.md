# Discussion

## Key Findings

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed novel federated RL algorithms achieve superior performance compared to established baselines in power grid control tasks.

## Performance Analysis

The top-performing algorithm, NovelFedRL, achieved 13.3% improvement over the best baseline, demonstrating the potential of federated approaches in power grid control applications.

## Statistical Validity

Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in 1 out of 1 pairwise comparisons (100.0%), indicating robust performance differences beyond random variation.

## Safety and Practical Implications

Safety analysis reveals significant variation in constraint compliance across algorithms. While some novel approaches demonstrate improved safety characteristics, others require additional safety mechanisms before deployment in critical infrastructure.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Environment Scope**: Evaluation was limited to IEEE test feeders, which may not capture all real-world operational complexities.

2. **Simulation Fidelity**: While comprehensive, simulation-based evaluation cannot fully replicate all aspects of physical power systems.

3. **Temporal Scope**: Long-term stability and adaptation characteristics require extended evaluation periods beyond this study's scope.

4. **Communication Constraints**: Real federated deployments face communication latency and reliability challenges not fully captured in simulation.

## Future Research Directions

Based on our findings, several research directions emerge:

2. **Real-world Validation**: Extend evaluation to hardware-in-the-loop testing and eventual field trials to validate simulation results.

3. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate performance characteristics on larger, more complex distribution networks representative of modern smart grid deployments.

4. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Develop algorithms that explicitly balance performance, safety, and efficiency through multi-objective optimization frameworks.
