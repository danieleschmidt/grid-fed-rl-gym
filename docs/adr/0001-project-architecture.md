# ADR-0001: Project Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish the foundational architecture for Grid-Fed-RL-Gym, a framework that combines power system simulation, reinforcement learning, and federated learning capabilities. The architecture must support:
- Realistic power distribution network modeling
- Multiple reinforcement learning algorithms (especially offline RL)
- Federated learning across utility companies
- Safety-critical constraints for power systems
- Integration with real-world SCADA systems

## Decision
We adopt a modular, layered architecture with the following key design principles:

### Core Modules:
1. **Environment Layer**: OpenAI Gym-compatible grid simulation environments
2. **Feeder Layer**: Power network topology and parameter definitions
3. **Algorithm Layer**: RL algorithms optimized for power systems
4. **Federated Layer**: Privacy-preserving distributed training
5. **Controller Layer**: Grid control logic and safety mechanisms
6. **Evaluation Layer**: Metrics and analysis tools

### Technology Stack:
- **Core Computation**: NumPy, SciPy for numerical operations
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch for deep learning and RL
- **Power Systems**: NetworkX for graph operations, pandapower for power flow
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic for configuration and data models
- **Federated Learning**: Custom implementation with crypten/opacus for privacy

### Interface Standards:
- OpenAI Gym compatibility for environments
- Standardized configuration using Pydantic models
- Plugin architecture for custom algorithms and feeders
- RESTful APIs for external system integration

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clear separation of concerns enables independent development
- Modular design allows for easy testing and validation
- Standard interfaces facilitate community contributions
- Scalable architecture supports both research and production use

### Negative:
- Additional complexity from abstraction layers
- Potential performance overhead from interface boundaries
- Requires discipline to maintain interface contracts

### Risks Mitigated:
- Safety-first design prevents unsafe control actions
- Modular testing reduces system-wide failure risks
- Plugin architecture allows for gradual feature rollout
