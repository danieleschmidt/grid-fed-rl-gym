# ADR-0002: Federated Learning Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Utility companies require privacy-preserving collaboration for training grid control policies. Historical operational data contains sensitive information about infrastructure, customer consumption patterns, and business operations. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches require data sharing, which violates privacy regulations and competitive concerns.

## Decision
Implement a federated learning framework with the following components:

### Privacy Mechanisms:
- **Differential Privacy**: Gaussian noise injection with configurable ε,δ parameters
- **Secure Aggregation**: Homomorphic encryption for gradient aggregation
- **Communication Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all federated communications

### Aggregation Strategies:
- **FedAvg**: Weighted averaging based on local dataset sizes
- **FedProx**: Proximal term to handle statistical heterogeneity
- **FedOpt**: Server-side optimization with Adam/AdaGrad

### Communication Optimization:
- **Gradient Compression**: Top-k sparsification and quantization
- **Local Updates**: Multiple local SGD steps to reduce communication rounds
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Support for clients with varying computational resources

### Implementation Framework:
- Custom federated orchestrator built on PyTorch
- Integration with Flower framework for production deployments
- Support for both simulation and real multi-party scenarios

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Enables privacy-preserving collaboration between utilities
- Supports heterogeneous data distributions across participants
- Configurable privacy-utility trade-offs via ε-differential privacy
- Reduced communication overhead through compression techniques

### Negative:
- Increased computational complexity from cryptographic operations
- Slower convergence compared to centralized training
- Additional infrastructure requirements for secure communication

### Implementation Considerations:
- Extensive testing required for privacy guarantees
- Monitoring needed for Byzantine fault tolerance
- Compliance validation for utility regulatory requirements
