# ADR-0003: Safety Constraints Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Power grid operations are safety-critical with strict operational constraints. Violations of voltage limits, thermal ratings, or frequency bounds can damage equipment, cause outages, or endanger personnel. RL algorithms must never take actions that violate these hard constraints, even during exploration or due to model uncertainty.

## Decision
Implement a multi-layered safety framework:

### Hard Constraint Categories:
1. **Voltage Constraints**: 0.95 ≤ V ≤ 1.05 per unit for all buses
2. **Thermal Constraints**: Line/transformer loading ≤ 100% of rating
3. **Frequency Constraints**: 59.5 ≤ f ≤ 60.5 Hz system-wide
4. **Equipment Limits**: DER output within manufacturer specifications
5. **Rate Limits**: Maximum rate of change for control actions

### Safety Architecture:
1. **Constraint Layer**: Mathematical constraint definitions and validation
2. **Safety Shield**: Real-time constraint checking with backup controller
3. **Safe Action Space**: Pre-computed safe action regions
4. **Penalty Functions**: Constraint violation costs in reward functions
5. **Emergency Override**: Hard stops for critical violations

### Implementation Strategy:
- **Constraint Checking**: Real-time validation before action execution
- **Backup Controller**: Rule-based fallback for constraint violations
- **Safe Exploration**: Constraint-aware exploration during training
- **Certification**: Mathematical proofs of safety for critical scenarios

### Integration Points:
- Environment step function validates all actions
- RL algorithms incorporate constraint costs
- Policy deployment includes safety verification
- Monitoring systems track constraint violations

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Guaranteed safety during both training and deployment
- Builds trust with utility operators and regulators
- Enables deployment in real power systems
- Provides clear failure modes and recovery mechanisms

### Negative:
- Reduces available action space and learning efficiency
- Increases computational overhead for real-time checking
- May limit optimal performance in favor of safety

### Risk Mitigation:
- Extensive testing on IEEE test feeders
- Hardware-in-the-loop validation before deployment
- Regulatory review and certification processes
- Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection
