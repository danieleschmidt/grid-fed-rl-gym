# Grid-Fed-RL-Gym Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Grid-Fed-RL-Gym  
**Project Type**: Open-Source Research Framework  
**Start Date**: January 2025

## Problem Statement

Power distribution networks face increasing complexity due to renewable energy integration, distributed energy resources (DERs), and dynamic load patterns. Traditional rule-based control systems struggle to optimize grid operations while maintaining safety and reliability. Meanwhile, utility companies possess vast historical operational data but cannot share it due to privacy and competitive concerns.

Current challenges include:
- Suboptimal grid control leading to reliability issues and economic losses
- Inability to leverage collective utility knowledge due to privacy constraints
- Risk of deploying untested AI control systems in safety-critical infrastructure
- Lack of standardized frameworks for federated learning in power systems
